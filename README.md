# Rhubarb-2-blender-custom-properties
This is a Blender python script which uses DanielSWolf's rhubarb-lip-sync
to generate keyframed custom properties from a `.wav` file. It requires
that you download Rhubarb separately.

To use, open `rhubarb-2-blender-custom-properties.py` in
Blender's scripting workspace, and read the documentation at the top of the
script, make the necessary modification, and run the script.
